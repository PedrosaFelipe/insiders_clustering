## A short description of the project

Project that aims to select the best buyers from a chain of stores in order to create a loyalty program.

#### This project was made by Felipe S. Pedrosa.

# 1. Business Problem.!

The company All in One Place is a Multibrand Outlet company, that is, it sells several second-line products from brands at a lower price, through an e-commerce. Based on this perception, the marketing time will launch a loyalty program for the best customers of the base, called Insiders. But time does not have an advanced knowledge in data analysis to elect program participants.
As a result for this project, you are expected to deliver a list of people eligible to participate in the Insiders program, along with a report answering the following questions:

1. Who are the people eligible to participate in the Insiders program?
1. How many customers will be part of the group?
1. What are the main characteristics of these customers?
1. What percentage of revenue contribution comes from Insiders?
1. What is the billing expectation of this group for the coming months?
1. What are the conditions for a person to be eligible for Insiders?
1. What are the conditions for a person to be removed from Insiders?
1. What is the guarantee that the Insiders program is better than the rest of the base?
1. What actions can the marketing team take to increase revenue? 


# 2. Business Assumptions.

In just over 1 year of operation, the marketing team realized that some customers from its base buy more expensive products, with high frequency and end up contributing a significant portion of the company's revenue.
You are part of the All In One Place team of data scientists, who need to determine who are eligible customers to participate in Insiders. In possession of this list, the Marketing team will carry out a sequence of personalized and exclusive actions for the group, in order to increase revenue and purchase frequency.

# 3. Solution Strategy

In possession of the groups, where a sale transaction took place, which took place between November 2016 and December 2017, we thought of grouping data with the premise of each representation line that the reference pro is the amount spent in the company in favor of the frequency of purchase, how many products in total you have purchased or any other variable.

 **Step 01. Data description**

When evaluating the dataset, the first situation of attention was that 135080 customers had an empty customer_id out of a total of 541909 customers. To get around the loss of a large number of buyers, it was made that each empty element was added the maximum number of customer_id valid plus 1, thus filling all the missing ones but putting a bias that each person not correctly filled in the database has bought only once. Finally, with the result not being satisfactory, they were just permanently excluded, reducing the number of data but without the imposed bias, greatly improving the grouping.

**Step 02. Data filtering:**

As many of the unit prices were set to 0, we put as a filtering all purchase values above 0.04 cents, in addition to excluding several stock_codes where the code was not the purchase or return code of the products.

**Step 03. Feature Engineering:**

We created some new columns to help the model, these being the gross_revenue, recency( Day from last purchase), quantity of purchased, Quantity total of items purchased , Quantity of products purchased, Avg Ticket Value, Frequency Purchase, Numbers of Returns.

**Step 04. Exploratory data analysis**

In this step, we did the space study, that is, we rescaled the columns and created an embeeding with UMAP and the reduction component was the dataframe, previously training with Random Forest Regressor and putting Gross_revenue as the reference variable.


**Step 05. Hyperparameter fine tunning** -- Come√ßar desde este ponto

The next step was to identify the most relevant features for training machine learning models. For this, in addition to the knowledge acquired during EDA, the Python implementations of the Boruta R package (https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py) was used.
The features chosen by Boruta are described in the notebook.

**Step 07. Machine learning modelling**

Different machine learning algorithms were evaluated and tested with cross-validation, with different hyperparameters each: balanced random forest classifier, knn classifier,logistic regression, random forest classifier and xgboost classifier; each of the studied algorithms is present in a separate notebook.
The "predict_proba" method (the probabilities for the target) was used to sort the customer's list and plot the cumulative gains and lift curves.
Finally, **precision@k** and **recall@k** (in this case, k = 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%) metrics were used to quantify the performance of the models and to choose the better one.

- The **precision@k** is the proportion of recommended items in the top-k set that are relevant, where k is the number (or percentage, in this case) of rows of the class 1 (those that are intereseted in vehicle insurance) in the sorted probability table.
- he **recall@k** is the proportion of relevant items found in the top-k recommendations.

**Step 08. Hyperparameter fine tunning**

The best model was the xgboost classifier. For this business problem, no significant performance gains were verified after the fine tuning of hyperparameters.

**Step 09. Convert model performance to business values**

The manager was given an ordered list of customers most likely to purchase vehicle insurance. When contacting the top 40% of the list, it is expected that there will be a conversion of at least 90% of the total interested in the product.

**Step 10. Deploy model to production**

To facilitate the use of the model and allow the ordering of new customer lists, the model was deployed on google sheets. When entering customer data and pressing the appropriate button, the tool displays the propensity score while sorting the list by this value. From this moment on, it is up to the company to contact as many customers as it wants to try to sell vehicle insurance, but always with the expectation that, by reaching the top 40% of the list, 90% of potential customers will be covered.
